Predicting Customer Life-Time Value (ltv) for an Online Greeting Card Company

Problem Statement: Key tasks 1.Develop an attrition model, to predict whether a customer will cancel their subscription in the near future. Characterize your model performance. 2.Develop a model for estimating the ltv of a customer. Characterize your model performance. 3.Develop a customer segmentation scheme. Include in this scheme the identification of sleeping customers, those that are no longer active but have not canceled their account.

This project has been done as a part of Data Mining course at Carnegie Mellon University under professor Alexandra Chouldechova. It is an attrition model to predict whether a customer will cancel their subscription in the next 6 months using Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Models. The accuracy achieved is 82% and sensitivity 85%. In this project we predicted the lifetime value of a customer using cross-validated regularized regression (Lasso), performed K-means clustering with PCA and Hierarchical clustering to segment customers as active or sleeping.
